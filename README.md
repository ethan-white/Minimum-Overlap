Code for optimization programs and feasible solutions.

The author of this repository recommends first familiarizing oneself with the basic ideas in https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05704. 

In this repository you will find code for four programs, all written in OPL and meant to be run on IBM's CPLEX software. A user may be able to somewhat easily convert between this language and another of their choosing. The programs are:

## MO_simple_primal.txt

## MO_simple_dual.txt

## MO_convex_primal.txt

## MO_convex_dual.txt
